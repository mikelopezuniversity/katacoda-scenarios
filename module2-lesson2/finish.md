In this scenario, you've learned to build your own Docker image, and launch it.  As you know, Docker
will store the images you build in the Docker engine.  This of course takes up quite a bit of
disk space.  Not only that, but how would you launch your image on a different computer? Enter
the Docker Registry! Docker allows you to 'push' your built images to a registry (like the
Docker hub), and of course 'pull' and launch them from any system Docker is installed on.
As a part of your Docker 101 purchase, you are given 5GB of storage space, in the MLU
Docker Registry.  Before proceeding to the next scenario, please surf to 
https://registry.mikelopezuniversity.ml, create your account, and familiarize yourself
with the registry.  Thank you.
