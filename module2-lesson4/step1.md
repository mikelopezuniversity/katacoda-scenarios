We’ll create a simple web application in Go for demonstration purposes.   This 
application, which we’ll call MathApp, will:

    Expose routes for different mathematical operations,
    Use HTML templates for views,
    Use a configuration file to customize the application, and
    Include tests for selected functions.

Visiting /sum/3/6 will show a page with the result of adding 3 and 6. Likewise, 
visiting /product/3/6 will show a page with the product of 3 and 6.

In this lesson, we used the Beego framework. Note that you can use any 
framework (or none at all) for your application.
