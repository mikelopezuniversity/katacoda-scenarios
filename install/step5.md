The moment we've all been waiting for has finally arrived! 
It's time to run the script, and install Docker.  Since
Docker is actually already installed in our virtual 
environment, we are technically upgraing not installing,
but the procedure is the same.  You will see a warning
about that when you run the script.  It is safe to ignore.
# TASK
Run the script, and install Docker.  `./getdocker.sh`{{execute}}
