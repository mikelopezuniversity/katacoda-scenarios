In this first scenario, you'll take the role of Joe, a developer who 
needs to deploy a new Key-Value Store for an application he's working 
on. After discussions with the rest of the team, it's been decided to 
use Redis, a popular KV Store.

Joe has no idea how Redis is deployed, but has heard Docker makes it 
straightforward to deploy services into development and production.
This scenario discusses how he will complete his task, and deploy 
Redis as a Docker Container.  Joe has installed docker in his 
development environment on a machine called docker. His local 
development machine has the Docker Client installed, and accessible via 
the command line.
