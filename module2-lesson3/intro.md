In our last scenario, we learned to build a basic Docker image.  This scenario
continues to explore how to build and deploy your applications as a Docker 
container. The previous scenario covered deploying a static HTML website. This
scenario explores deploying a Node.js application within a Docker container.

The environment is configured with access to a personal Docker instance, and 
the code for a default Expressjs application is in the working directory. To 
view the code use `ls`{{execute}}, and cat <filename> or use the editor.

The name of the machine Docker is running on is docker. If you want to access 
any of the services, then use the machine nam instead of localhost or 0.0.0.0.
