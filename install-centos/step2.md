Install the Dependencies

The next step is to download the dependencies required for installing 
Docker.

Type in the following command:

`sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2`{{execute}}

The –y flag indicates to the yum installer it should answer “yes” to any 
prompts that come up. Yum-utils adds the yum-config-manager.
