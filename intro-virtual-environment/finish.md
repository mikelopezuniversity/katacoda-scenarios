That concludes the introduction to the virtual environment.  You may spend 
some time playing around weith the terminal if you wish.  Try out some
commands, pretty much any Linux command should work.  

You may also return here anytime while going through the course.  Use the
terminal to write your assignments, try out new ideas, whatever.  You don't
have to worry about dammaging anything.  Nothing you do in the terminal, or 
the editor is permenant.  

You do not have access to open your own files in the editor.  However, Ubuntu
has a built in editor which is installed in t6he environment.  To run it,
simply type nano in the terminal and press enter.  This will be useful for
writing your assignments. If you do that, don't forget you can't save.  Once
you leave the environment, everything you've done will be gone.  You can 
however, copy everything to clipboard, and paste it into a file on your 
computer.  I won't go into how to do that here.  If you need help, send me
a message and I will help you.
