There are only a couple more things to show you, then we can get on with the 
course.

The first, is copy to editor.  There are times in this course, when you need 
to copy text from this side of the page, to the editor.  Durring those times,
a copy to editor button will appear.  Clicking it will cause the text to be
sent to the editor.  It will look like this:

<pre class="file" data-filename="somefile.txt" data-target="prepend">
This is the text that will be copied to the editor when you click the copy
to editor button.
</pre>

The second, is copy to clipboard.  Text can be copied to your clipboard, and 
pasted in the terminal, the editor, a file on your computer, etc. Text that 
can be copied will look like this:

`This is the text that can be copied to clipboard`{{copy}}
