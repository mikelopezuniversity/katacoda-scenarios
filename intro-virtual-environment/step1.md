To the right of the screen, you'll notice a split screen.  The upper half is a
text editor, which in some of the lessopns you will use to view and edit files,
and the bottom half is a command line terminal.  The terminal uses the Ubuntu
Linux operating system, and has Docker pre-installed.  

At times durring the course, you will need to open files in the text editor. 
To do so, simply click on the name of the file.  You will see the name, 
as a link, on this side of the screen.  It will look something like this:

`Dockerfile`{{open}}


Throughout the course, you will be executing various commands in the terminal.
This can be done without typing each command.  Where there are commands to
be executed, they will appear as links here like this:

`docker version`{{execute}}

Clicking on the above, will cause the command docker version to be executed
in the terminal.
